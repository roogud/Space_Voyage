          </h3>
          <p>Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence about the origins of our solar system.</p>

  Facts

        <div class="col m6">
          <p>As of 2006, Pluto is not longer considered a planet, but rather designated as a “dwarf planet,” meaning that it is a planetary-mass object being neither a planet nor a satellite. Pluto was declassified as a planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>
          <p>Pluto is the smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System, smaller than Earth’s Moon, and half the width of Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede.</p>
          <p>Pluto’s journey around the Sun takes 248 Earth years. This means that, since its discovery in 1930, it still has over 160 years to go until it has made a complete orbit around the Sun.</p>
          <p>Pluto’s atmosphere is composed of a thin layer of gas containing carbon monoxide, methane, and nitrogen. Its atmospheric pressure has been estimated to be 1/700,000 compared with that of earth.</p>

          <p>Pluto orbits the Sun on a different plane than the 8 planets, going over them and below them.</p>

          <p>Pluto has five known moons. In order of distance from Pluto they are Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. The largest of Pluto's moons is called Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto and weighs about 7 times less than Pluto. It is tidally locked with Pluto such that the combination of Pluto+Charon is sometimes thought of as a binary object. Astronomers think that Charon might be covered with water ice. The second and third moons to be discovered were Nix and Hydra; these are very small moons and are thought to be between 30 and 100 miles across. Kerberos and Styx are the most recently discovered moons.</p>

          <p>A day on Pluto is equivalent to Earth’s 6 days and 9 hours, meaning that it has the second slowest rotation in the Solar System (after Venus, which takes 243 days to turn on its axis).</p>
          <p>Pluto’s orbit is elliptical, meaning that it can come closer to the Sun than Neptune, but then go almost two billion kilometers further away from Neptune’s orbit.</p>
          <p>Pluto is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. When viewed through a telescope, it looks like a star.</p>

          <p>One Neptune day is equal to 16 hours in Earth time.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col m6">
        <p>Pluto is cold: -233° C (-390° F), just 40° C (72° F) above absolute zero. At this temperature, all elements would be frozen except for neon, hydrogen, and helium.</p>
        <p>Pluto maximum distance from the Sun – 7.38 billion km (4.6 billion miles).</p>
        <p> Pluto’s minimum distance from Earth – 4.28 billion km (2.7 billion miles).</p>

        <p>When gazing at the Sun from Pluto it would appear as a tiny bright start because the two are so far away from each other.</p>
        <p>Pluto was first located by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons why Pluto was declassified as a planet was because there are asteroids in the solar system that are bigger than Pluto.</p>
        <p>Since being declassified as a planet, Pluto’s technical name is now 134340.</p>
